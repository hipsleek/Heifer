  The specification requires that:
  - Preconditions of h and g initially hold
  - Assignment to x does not interfere with the preconditions of h and g
  - h and g does not capture y and the assignment to y is guaranteed to be
    non-interfering
  - Invoking h does not interfere with the precondition of g
  --> This requires the modelling of ownership, like in Rust.
