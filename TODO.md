# TODO

- Refactor the use of `verifier_getAFreeVar`: all functions that acts on variables should go into a separate module `Variables`.
- Put common utilities into `utils`: Common, List, Map, etc.
- Fix forward verifier rules.
- Call to entails/normalization.
- Check the translation in `core_lang`.
